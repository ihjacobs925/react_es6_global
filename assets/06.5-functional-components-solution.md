# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Functional Components: Solution

All in all, the functional `ToDoList` component should look like this:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ListItem from './ListItem';

const ToDoList = props => (
  <ul>
    {props.toDoItemArray.map((item, index) => (
      <ListItem doThis={item} key={index} />
    ))}
  </ul>
)

export default ToDoList
```

If you'd like to see this work, all you need to do is change your `MyList.js` to call the new component.
First, import the new `ToDoList` component and file at the top of `MyList.js`.
Then, delete the `let todoItems...` `map` method from the `render` function- you now do this in the ToDoList component.
Finally, change the call in the `return` statement from `{todoItems}` to `<ToDoList toDoItemArray={this.state.toDoItemArray} />` - calling the ToDoList component and passing in the ToDoList.

Great job! You've mastered functional components.
